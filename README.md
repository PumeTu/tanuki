# minigrad

A Deep Learning framework written in Python and Numpy, mainly used to check my understanding of how things work. I am a firm believer of if you want to truly understand the underlyings of how something works you have to be able to implement it. Thus, after procastinating for years, I am starting minigrad to implement all the layers and see if I truly understand Deep Learning and mainly autograd. Will start off implementing CNN stuff then go into NLP and idk how but maybe RL.
